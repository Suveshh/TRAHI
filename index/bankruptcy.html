            <p class="text-start">Bankruptcy is a legal proceeding initiated when a person or business is unable to repay outstanding debts or obligations. It offers a fresh start for people who can no longer afford to pay their bills.

                The bankruptcy process begins with a petition filed by the debtor, which is most common, or on behalf of creditors, which is less common. All of the debtor's assets are measured and evaluated, and the assets may be used to repay a portion of the outstanding debt.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">Bankruptcy offers an individual or business a chance to start fresh by forgiving debts that they can't pay. Meanwhile, creditors have a chance to get some repayment based on the individual's or business's assets available for liquidation.

                In theory, the ability to file for bankruptcy benefits the overall economy by allowing people and companies a second chance to gain access to credit. It can also help creditors regain a portion of debt repayment.

                All bankruptcy cases in the United States go through federal courts. A bankruptcy judge makes decisions, including whether a debtor is eligible to file and whether they should be discharged of their debts.
                Administration over bankruptcy cases is often handled by a trustee, an officer appointed by the United States Trustee Program of the Department of Justice, to represent the debtor's estate in the proceeding. The debtor and the judge usually have no contact unless there is some objection made in the case by a creditor. When bankruptcy proceedings are complete, the debtor is relieved of the debt obligations.

        <h4>Advantages and Disadvantages of Bankruptcy</h4>
        <p>Declaring bankruptcy can help relieve you of your legal obligation to pay your debts and save your home, business, or ability to function financially, depending on which kind of bankruptcy petition you file. But it also will likely lower your credit rating, making it more difficult to get a loan, mortgage, credit card, buy a home or business, or rent an apartment.</p>
        <p>If you're trying to decide whether you should file for bankruptcy, your credit is probably already damaged. But it's worth noting that a Chapter 7 filing will stay on your credit report for 10 years, while a Chapter 13 will remain there for seven. Any creditors or lenders you apply to for new debt (such as a car loan, credit card, line of credit, or mortgage) will see the discharge on your report, which can prevent you from getting any credit.</p>
        <h4>Bankruptcy Pros and Cons</h4>
        <p><ul>
            <strong>Pros</strong>
            <li>Allows debtors to emerge from default</li>
            <li>Wipes clean certain unsecured debts
            </li>
            <li>Avoids legal judgment</li>
            <strong>Cons</strong>
            <li>Leaves a scar on one's credit score</li>
            <li>Secured debts will have the collateral seized</li>
            <li>Certain debts like child support not eligible for discharge</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Alternatives to Bankruptcy</h4>
        <p>
            If you want to avoid bankruptcy,
            <br> several alternatives may be able <br> to reduce your debt obligations.
            <br>
            Negotiating with your creditors without involving the courts can sometimes work to the benefit of both sides. Rather than risk receiving nothing, a creditor might agree to a repayment schedule that reduces your debt or spreads your payments over a longer period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are unable to make your mortgage payments, it's worth calling your loan servicer to find out what options you might have, short of filing for bankruptcy. Those could include forbearance, which will allow you to stop making payments for a specified time, or a repayment plan designed to stretch smaller monthly payments over a longer period.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another option might be loan modification, which will change the terms of your loan (such as lowering the interest rate) on a permanent basis, making it easier to repay. However, beware of unsolicited offers from companies claiming that they can keep your home out of foreclosure. They may be nothing more than scam artists.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you owe tax money to the IRS, you may be eligible for an offer in compromise, allowing you to settle with the agency for an amount less than you owe. In some instances, the IRS also offers monthly payment plans for taxpayers who cannot pay their tax obligations all at once.
        </p>
        <h4>Is Bankruptcy a Good choice? </h4>
        <p>
            For some people or businesses, unfortunately, bankruptcy is the right choice. If debts become too large to manage, the alternative could be a liquidation of all of your assets and legal judgments for non-payment or breach of contract. While damaging to your credit and reputation, bankruptcy is a legal channel for avoiding the worst-case scenario described above.
