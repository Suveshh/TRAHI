            <p class="text-start">A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease. Viral respiratory diseases, such as those caused by a new influenza virus or the coronavirus COVID-19, are the most likely to turn into a pandemic.A pandemic is not the same as an epidemic. In an epidemic, many more cases of a health condition occur than would normally develop in a community or region, but the condition does not spread further.
            </p>
            <p class="text-start">In the past, there have been numerous influenza pandemics. Pandemic influenzas often have their origin in animal influenza viruses and are not the same as seasonal influenza. Few people, if any, will have immunity against a pandemic influenza virus — even if they have had seasonal flu or a seasonal flu vaccination.

        <h4>Significant features of a pandemic are listed below:</h4>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Affects a wider geographical area, often global.
            </li>
            <li>Infects a very large number of people.</li>
            <li>Often caused by a new virus or a new strain of a virus that has been dormant for many years.</li>
            <li>Spreads quickly in humans as there is little to no existing immunity.</li>
            <li>Can cause a high number of deaths.</li>
            <li>Because of the need to control the spread of the disease, there is often social disruption, unrest and economic loss</li>

        <h4>Stages of a Pandemic</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The WHO has identified six phases that it follows before declaring a pandemic[11]. Phase 1 represents a low risk and phase 6 is a full-blown pandemic, you can see the phases below:
            <ul>
                <li>Phase 1 - a virus is seen in animals but has not been shown to infections in humans</li>
                <li>Phase 2 - a known animal virus has caused an infection in humans</li>
                <li>Phase 3 - scattered or isolated incidence of cases or small clusters of the disease occurring in humans; possible cases of human-to-human transmission but not at a level to cause community-level outbreaks</li>
                <li>Phase 4 - human to human transmission at a rate that causes an outbreak in communities</li>
                <li>Phase 5 - the spread of the disease between humans is now evident in more than one country</li>
                <li>Phase 6 - community-level outbreaks are in at least one additional country other than that seen in phase 5.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Prevention</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                There is no sure way to prevent the spread of disease during an outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic. It might take scientists a long time to make a vaccine. But it is easier to make specific vaccines more quickly now than it was several years ago. Once a vaccine is ready, people and groups who are more likely to become ill will get it first.
                In the meantime, you can take other steps to stay healthy:
                <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water. If that is not an option, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner or gel sanitizer. Rub it on your hands until they are dry.
                </li>
                <li>Don't touch your mouth, nose, and eyes unless you've just washed your hands.</li>
                <li>When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. Then throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands afterward.</li>
                <li>Avoid crowded places. Stay home if you can.</li>
                <li>Clean and disinfect household surfaces every day.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                If you get sick:
                <li>Have only one person care for you, if possible.</li>
                <li>Wear a face mask if you have to go out for medical care. Avoid public transportation and taxis.</li>
                <li>Wash your hands often, and keep household surfaces clean and disinfected.</li>
            </ul>
