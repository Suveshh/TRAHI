            <h2>Health emergencies</h2>
            <p>
                All countries face risks and potential health threats from an increasing range of hazards, including infectious diseases, chemical and radio nuclear incidents, food contamination, and threats associated with climate change including extreme weather events and deforestation.

                Risk factors, including poverty, gender, age, migration, health and nutritional status, displacement, unplanned urbanization, increase people's exposure and vulnerability to these threats and hazards.
            </p>
            </div>
        <p>
            Health Emergencies and public health threats, particularly those at the level of
            epidemics and pandemics, have become a global challenge requiring a coordinated
            and prompt global response. It is important to ensure that the global health governance
            and support structures with the WHO at its core are robust and suited to deal with such
            emerging challenges as COVID 19 pandemic. The COVID Pandemic is not only an
            unprecedented challenge confronting the world with its socio-economic impact beyond
            the health sector but also a historic opportunity to build a new global partnership with
            reformed and effective multilateralism.
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Strengthening the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)
                 declaration process: </strong>Currently the decision making is primarily on the
                 recommendation of International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency
                 Committee.                 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Funding:</strong>Most of the financing for Programmatic Activities of the WHO comes from
                    extra budgetary contributions, which though voluntary in nature, are normally
                    earmarked. The WHO enjoys very little flexibility in use of these funds. Assessed
                    contributions comprise less than one-fifth of the WHO's Budget. Even the Health
                    Emergencies Programme is not fully funded from the regular budget. There are
                    also many important non-Governmental organisations in global health
                    architecture, with budgets significantly larger than that of the WHO, such as
                    Global Fund, UNAIDS, GAVI and UNITAID.
                    </li>
                <li><strong>Ensuring transparency of funding mechanism and accountability framework:</strong> Presently, only broad-based priorities are discussed with member states and in
                    respect of selection of activities, their expenditure and concurrent monitoring,
                    there is no regular and institutional mechanism involving the member states. There
                    is no collaborative mechanism wherein the actual projects and activities are
                    decided in consultation with member states, there is no review with respect to
                    value for money and whether projects are being done as per the member states
                    priorities or if there are abnormal delays. Without the same, the technical
                    assistance to member states primarily is neither transparent nor adding the
                    required value to the member states.
                    There is an urgent need for effective involvement of Member States in discussions
                    on budget implementation and spending. This is imperative to strengthen efforts
                    towards enhancing cost efficiencies and value for money proposition. 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Enhancement of the response capacities of the WHO and Member States:</strong>Implementation of the IHR 2005 has highlighted critical gaps in the basic health
                    infrastructure of member States. This has become more evident in their dealing
                    with COVID 19 pandemic.
                    </li>
                <li><strong>Improvement of the WHO's governance structure:</strong>The two policy making organs
                    of the WHO i.e. the World Health Assembly and the Executive Board are currently
                    playing a peripheral role. (This is more pronounced in case of the Executive Board).
                    Being a technical Organisation, most of the work in WHO is done in Technical
                    Committees composed of independent experts. Moreover, in light of the growing
                    risks associated with emergence of disease outbreaks the role of the Independent
                    Oversight and Advisory Committee (IOAC), responsible for the performance of the
                    WHO Health Emergencies Programme (WHE), becomes extremely crucial. It is
                    necessary for this oversight mechanism to be strengthened and the inputs of
                    Member States to be integrated. These inputs need not only be taken during EB or
                    WHA but there should be a mechanism for concurrent and regular coordination
                    of IOAC with member states</li>
                <li><strong>Improvement in IHR Implementation:</strong>The Member States have a self-reporting
                    obligation under IHR 2005. However, review of IHR implementation is voluntary. It
                    has been proposed by some States that peer review of the IHR implementation
                    should be made mandatory, like the review of the human rights through the UPR
                    mechanism through an intergovernmental peer review process. It has also been
                    proposed that the WHO should be given necessary tools to ensure compliance
                    with the IHR</li>
                <li><strong>Access to therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics: </strong> It has been felt that the TRIPS
                    flexibilities provided for public health, under Doha Declaration, may not be
                    sufficient to deal with crises such as COVID 19 pandemic. There have been
                    instances of restrictions on trade in public health goods in the initial phase of
                    COVID 19. Also, as a reflection of vaccine nationalism, some developed countries
                    have been signing bilateral agreements with vaccine manufacturers, leaving very
                    little space for developing countries to get fair, affordable and equitable access
                    to the same. India and South Africa have moved a proposal at the WTO for a
                    COVID 19 specific waiver of some of the provisions of TRIPS Agreement. Lack of
                    awareness of TRIPS flexibilities and an enabling national mechanism has made it
                    difficult for the developing countries to benefit from these provisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Creation of Global Framework for Management of Infectious Diseases &
                    Pandemics:</strong>There is a need to create a monitoring mechanism and support to
                    member states on International Health Regulations, preparedness of infrastructure,
                    human resources and relevant health systems capacities such as testing and
                    surveillance systems. </li>
                <li><strong>Role of Hosted Partnerships in pandemic management:</strong>The risks imposed on
                    humankind, by new influenza viruses causing more disease outbreaks are very
                    real. There is an urgent need for the global community to address this issue by
                    making bold efforts and ensuring vigilance and preparedness in our healthcare
                    systems. The current Pandemic management systems may be proving to be
                    insufficient in enabling agile and robust responses with respect to protecting
                    global citizens against disease outbreaks.</li>
