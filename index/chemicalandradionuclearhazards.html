            <p class="text-start">Accidents in nuclear power plants can lead to contamination of territories over thousands of square kilometres over tens to hundreds of year by alpha-, beta- and gamma- radiation, requiring zoning and evacuation measures (NCRP, 2010).

                The Code of Condust on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources (the Code) was established to achieve and maintain a high level of safety and security of radioactive sources across the globe. The IAEA Preventive Measures for Nuclear and Other Radioactive Material out of Regulatory Control serves as a guidance document for Member States interested in strengthening their nuclear security regime as it relates to nuclear and other radioactive materials out of regulatory control and in improving their capabilities.

        <h4>Sources of Nuclear Pollution / Hazards/ Radioactive Pollution:</h4>
        <p><ol>
            The sources of nuclear pollution include
            both natural and manmade sources.. The human environment has always been radioactive and accounts for
            up to 85% of the annual human radiation dose. Radiation arising from human activities typically accounts
            for up to 15% of the public's exposure every year.
            <li><strong>Natural Sources:</strong> Most radiation exposure is from natural sources. These include: radioactivity in
                rocks and soil of the Earth's crust; radon, a radioactive gas given out by many volcanic rocks and uranium
                ore, cosmic radiations etc.
                <ul>
                    <li>Cosmic rays from outer space. The quantity depends on altitude and latitude; it is more at higher
                    latitudes and high altitudes.</li>
                    <li>Emissions from radioactive materials in the Earth Crust i.e. Rocks, Marine sediments etc.</li>
                </ul> 
                 
            </li>
            <li><strong>Man-Made Sources: </strong> These sources involve any process that emanates radiation in the
                environment. While there are many causes of radiation pollution such as including research and
                medical procedures and wastes, nuclear power plants etc. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Nuclear waste handling and disposal: It may generate low to medium radiation over long period
                        of times. The radioactivity may contaminate and propagate through air, water, and soil as well.
                        Thus, their effects may not be easily distinguishable and are hard to predict. The main issue with
                        the radiation waste is the fact that it cannot be degraded or treated chemically or biologically. Thus,
                        the only options are to contain the waste by storing it in tightly closed containers shielded with
                        radiation-protective materials (such as Pb) or, if containing is not possible, to dilute it. The waste
                        may also be contained by storage in remote areas with little or no life (such as remote caves or
                        abandoned salt mines). However, in time, the shields (natural or artificial) may be damaged.
                        Additionally, the past waste disposal practices may not have used appropriate measures to isolate
                        the radiation. Thus, such areas need to be carefully identified and access restrictions promptly
                        imposed. </li>
                    <li> Use of radioactive materials in Defense weapon production: Nuclear weapon production may
                        also release radiations from the handled radioactive materials (usually of high health risks).
                        However, unless accident occurs, the current standards will not allow the release of any significant
                        amount of radiation.</li>
                        <li>. Nuclear explosions and detonations of nuclear weapons: The highest amounts of humaninduced radiation pollution have been generated probably in the mid twenty century through
                            various experimental or combat nuclear detonations,that ended the Second World War</li>
                        <li>Mining and processing of radioactive ores: It involve the crushing and processing of radioactive
                            ores and generate radioactive by-products. Mining of other ores may also generate radioactive
                            wastes (such as mining of phosphate ores).
                            </li>
                            <li>Nuclear accidents: explosion at Three Mile Island 1979 and Chernobyl 1986 nuclear-power plant
                                accidents are the classic examples of radiation pollution from this type of source. Even accidents
                                from handling medical nuclear materials/wastes could have radiation health effects on workers.</li>
                            <li>Use of radioactive isotopes in medical, industrial and research applications: The greatest
                                exposure to human beings comes from the diagnostic use of X-rays, radioactive isotopes used as
                                tracers and treatment of cancer and other ailments.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Control of nuclear hazards:</h4>
        <p>
            Peaceful uses of radioactive materials are so wide and effective that we cannot go without them but also
            there is no cure for radiation damage. Thus the only option against nuclear hazards is to check and prevent
            radioactive pollution. Following are the ways to prevent or control these hazards:

            <ul>
                <li>Leakages from nuclear reactors, careless handling, transport and use of radioactive fuels,
                fission products and radioactiveisotopes have to be totally stopped.
                </li>
                <li>Safety measures should be enforced strictly and strengthened against nuclear accidents.</li>
                <li>There should be regular monitoring and quantitative analysis through frequent sampling in
                the risk areas.</li>
                <li>Preventive measures should be followed so that background radiation levels do not exceed
                    the permissible limits.</li>
                <li>Appropriate steps should be taken against occupational exposure.
                </li>
                <li>Waste disposal must be careful, efficient and effective.
                </li>
            </ul>
